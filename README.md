# USAGE

Schedule the program to run hourly (or whatever interval you prefer) to be notified when your credit usage exceeds your configured "acceptable cost per interval".

Ideal for use with Flexible plans since you can be notified if your costs start to increase (possibly due to a rogue process eating too much CPU time).

Requires <a href="https://github.com/rickparrish/lndapi">lndapi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rickparrish/RMLib">RMLib</a> to build.
